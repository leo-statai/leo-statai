## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Leo, a curious student passionate about learning and exploring the world of computers, software, and data. When I'm not studying, you can find me watching series/movies and experimenting with AI.
In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball and capturing life's moments through photography. I believe that learning is a lifelong journey, and I'm excited to share my projects and experiences with the GitHub community.
